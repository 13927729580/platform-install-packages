6 Quick Tips for Smooth Kaltura Maintenance -


Tip #1:

Join the community discussion board at: https://forum.kaltura.org to get help, meet other Kaltura community members and share your Kaltura stories!


Tip #2:

In order to automate your Kaltura server deployment and upgrades - you can use the answers file that was generated for you during the installation, and pass it as a parameter to the post-install script. 

Find your answers file at: @ANSFILE@


Tip #3:

Check your install log, and verify everything went smoothly. 

Find your install log file at: @BASE_DIR@/log


Tip #4:
If you ever come across issues, increase log verbosity to 7 using the following method.        
Run the following command using root:    
sed -i 's@^writers.\(.*\).filters.priority.priority\s*=\s*7@writers.\1.filters.priority.priority=4@g' /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/logger.ini
Then restart your Apache.    

Run `kaltlog` (using root), which will continuously track (using `tail`) an error grep from all Kaltura log files.

You can also use: `allkaltlog` (using root), which will dump all the error lines from the Kaltura logs once. Note that this can result in a lot of output, so the best way to use it will be to redirect to a file: `allkaltlog > errors.txt`.
This output can be used to analyze past failures but for active debugging use the kaltlog alias.
