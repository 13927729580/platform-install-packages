scripts/build dir
=================
sources.rc - this file has the ENV vars needed for building from sources. When versions of components are upgraded, they should be modified there.
package_*.sh - each component has a wrapper script that fetches the sources from the needed version and packages them so that the RPM can be built.

Utility scripts
===============
push_rpm.sh - scp the RPM to repo origin and sign it over SSH, then, generate meta data with create repo
