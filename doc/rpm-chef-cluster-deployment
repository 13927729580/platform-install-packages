Installing the Chef server
==========================

0. Request this page: http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/
1. Select the 'Chef Server' tab
2. Select your distribution, version and arch and download

Download the RPM or deb package depending on your distribution.
The post install will provide instructions as to what else needs to be done to set the instance up.

3. Obtain chef-repo from https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages.git
4. Upload the Kaltura recipes to your Chef server using:
# knife cookbook upload kaltura
We also recommend you use the ready made recipes for MySQL and NFS which can be taken from here:
http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/mysql
http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/nfs

Bootstrapping clients
=====================
# curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh|sh
# mkdir -p /etc/chef
# knife configure client /etc/chef
copy /etc/chef/validation.pem from your Chef server onto /etc/chef
Create a barebone /etc/chef/client.rb on the client:
#/etc/chef/client.rb on Node 
log_level :info
log_location STDOUT
chef_server_url 'http://yourchefserver.com:4000'
validation_client_name 'chef-validator'
# chef-client -i 3600 
To test it, on the server, run: 
# knife node list 
This should list your newly added client.

Repeat this action for each node in your Kaltura cluster.
