          <p>To enable the of use standard binary packages and package managers to deploy the Kaltura platform.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li class="starli">This project sole purpose is to create standard installation packages for the Kaltura platform. It will make the installation process far easier (compared to the existing PHP/bash installers) and allow users to use package managers (aptitude, yum, synaptic, kpackage, etc.) and install Kaltura as you would any other binary package in your operating system of choice.</li>
            <li class="starli">A longer term goal of this project is to allow standard distribution of the Kaltura platform via the official distribution repositories.</li>
          </ul>

            Why do we need package installers?
          </h2>
          
          <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1cFFgGf" target="_blank">deb</a> and <a href="http://red.ht/1cFFhtI" target="_blank">RPM</a> are the de-facto standard for binary installations on Linux. Using this installation method will yield the following advantages to Kaltura admins:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compatibility with the industry standards for installing linux packages, simplifying prerequisites and platform installation and wider and easier package distribution.</li>
            <li>Simplified upgrade flow using standard package manager commands.</li>
            <li>Simplified patch deployment using standard package manager commands.</li>
            <li>Clean and organized components versioning and changes-log using standard package manager commands.</li>
            <li>Faster configuration post system upgrade - When upgrading, package managers would show a diff between current configuration files and the ones in the package.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <br />

            Is this project only Linux focused?
          </h2>
          
          <p>Since Kaltura is built mostly in PHP and platform independant technologies, it is theoretically possible to deploy Kaltura on any OS.<br />
            In the longer term we would love for this project to expand beyond deb and RPM packages to other distributions and operating systems.<br />
            However, since the majority of Kaltura users and, majority of servers on the web, are Linux based, this project is started off focusing only on deb and RPM packages.<br />
            We will try as much as possible to keep a common folder and coding practices that will allow porting easier later.<br />
            If you are using Kaltura on another distribution or operating system, and have experience in creating installation packages - your help and contribution to the project will be greatly appreciated!<br />

            Which Linux distributions will be supported?
          </h2>
          
          <p>Following results from a recent Kaltura community usage survey, we've set this project to target the most popular Linux distros among Kaltura users, which includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ubuntu versions 12.04 [LTS] and above.</li>
            <li>RHEL/CentOS 5.n and 6.n, and Fedora-Core 18 and above.</li>
          </ul>

          <span style="color: #666;font-style: italic;font-size:0.8em;">We would love to have every known linux distribution supported! However the reality is that there’s a lot of work in maintaining each package. We hope that the larger community could help port and extend the packages into more distros as the project progresses.</span>

          </h3>
          
          <p>While the packages will provide a complete installation on the system, post-installation configuration is always required, especially in clustered/multi-server environments. At this phase we will perform initial testing, and focus on preparing all necessary instructions into a post-install system configuration guide for the sys-admin wanting to deploy Kaltura.</p>

          At this phase admins who are not necessarily developers, and beta testers are welcome to run the package installation using package managers of their liking, submit bugs and feature requests, and help make the packages stable and ready for public release.</p>

          This phase will also allow us to clean things up, prepare any needed documentation, and submit official requests to each official distro repositories (<a href="http://bit.ly/1lpdUng" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/Jlkm2G" target="_blank">Fedora</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1bv2YyI" target="_blank">Debian</a>).</p>

          <p>This project has an open call-for-participation even before a single line of code was written. Why not wait till there’s at least an early alpha? Because the installation of Kaltura has been a major hurdle for everyone in the community, and we want to make sure you are involved from the very beginning - the deeper you get with the code, the better and more stable this project will be!<br />
          On a weekly basis the community team will update this page with project progress, so you can stay up to date, but you can also watch the github repositories and get updates when new code is pushed.</p>

          <p>There will be a weekly <a href="http://bit.ly/kaltura-webchat" target="_blank">IRC (#kaltura on freenode.net)</a> meeting every Tuesday at 10am NY time, where we openly discuss project status and details.<br />
          Join us at #kaltura on freenode and share your feedback, insights and ideas for the project!</p>

                  Under Specifications & Definitions, why did we decide to break the server roles the way we did and not in other ways?
                </li>
                <li class="answerli">
                  We wish to support a full cluster setup and maintain a modular structure to allow for easier server roles and respected maintainance and updates.<br />
                  The Kaltura architecture allows designating each server (or group of servers for more computing power and redundancy purposes) with its own dedicated role (batch, front, Sphinx, etc.) but it is also possible to have a server that has multiple or all roles assigned to it.<br />
                  By creating a package for each server role, we allow for easy support of both setup types, and gain a modular structure that allows for simpler updating/patching each individual server role.<br />
                  If you wish to assign only one role, install the package for that role (all packages will also automatically require the kaltura-common package to be installed by the linux package manager), if you wish to have an all-in-one server, simply install all packages.</li>

            </li>
            
            <li class="questionanswerli">
              <ul>
                <li class="questionli">
                  Are we compiling the requirements (e.g. sphinx, ffmpeg) or relying on other applications already distributed in the official repositories?
                </li>
                <li class="answerli">
                  For MySQL and PHP, we use standard packages from the distributions official repository.<br />
                  For Sphinx and ffmpeg, this cannot be done because a robust and stable Kaltura deployment requires very particular versions, often because they are newer and include fixes for crucial bugs, and additional functionality.<br />
                  Therefore, some libraries will be supplied as separate packages which the kaltura packages will depend on.<br />
                  Note that these packages will be installed under the Kaltura directory structure and thus will not conflict or override the parallel packages from the official distribution repository.<br />
                  Nevertheless, this is a good time to remind that video processing is a demanding task and should be on its own dedicated machine - it is not recommended to install Kaltura alongside other production software on the same machine.

                <li class="answerli">
                  The Kaltura platform basically works with the following users:<br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>Apache user: the default one each distribution sets up - for Debian/Ubuntu it is ‘www-data’, for RHEL/CentOS/FC it is ‘apache’.</li>
                    <li>The ‘kaltura’ user: used for running our Sphinx daemon, the populate daemon (responsible for syncing MySQL and Sphinx) and various other aiding scripts, like cache cleaning, etc.</li>

                  For security purposes, none of the Kaltura processes will run as root.
